    {
        "id": 1,
        "topic": "soil_health",
        "question": "How often should I get my soil tested?",
        "answer": "Get your soil tested every 2 years before the sowing season. Under the Soil Health Card scheme, the government provides free testing. Collect samples from 6-8 spots at 15 cm depth, mix them, and send 500 g to the nearest soil testing lab. This helps optimize fertilizer use and can save Rs 2,000-3,000/ha.",
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "topic": "fertilizer",
        "question": "How much urea should I apply to wheat?",
        "answer": "For irrigated timely-sown wheat, the total nitrogen recommendation is 120 kg N/ha (about 260 kg urea/ha). Apply in 2 splits: half at sowing as basal and half at the first irrigation (CRI stage, 21 days after sowing). Never apply all urea at once — it causes lodging and is inefficient.",
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "topic": "irrigation",
        "question": "Which is the most critical irrigation for wheat?",
        "answer": "The Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage irrigation at 21 days after sowing is the most critical. Skipping this single irrigation can reduce yield by 30-40%. If you can only irrigate once, always irrigate at CRI. The second most important is at flowering (80-85 DAS).",
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "topic": "pest_management",
        "question": "How do I identify and control yellow rust in wheat?",
        "answer": "Yellow rust appears as yellow-orange powdery stripes on the upper surface of leaves, usually during January-February when temperatures are 10-15°C with high humidity. Spray Propiconazole 25 EC @ 1 ml/L or Tebuconazole 250 EC @ 1 ml/L. Use 500 L water per hectare. Repeat after 15 days if needed. Prevention: sow resistant varieties like HD 3226 or PBW 826.",

        "id": 5,
        "topic": "schemes",
        "question": "How can I apply for PM-KISAN?",
        "answer": "Visit pmkisan.gov.in or your village panchayat/Common Service Centre. You need: Aadhaar card, Aadhaar-linked bank account, and land records (khatauni). The scheme gives Rs 6,000/year in 3 installments of Rs 2,000 each directly to your bank account. All landholding families are eligible except income tax payers and government employees.",
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "topic": "schemes",
        "question": "What is the benefit of Kisan Credit Card?",
        "answer": "KCC provides short-term crop loans at just 4% interest (with prompt repayment subvention) against the normal 7-9%. You get a credit limit up to Rs 3 lakh without collateral. It can be used for crop production costs, post-harvest expenses, and even allied activities like dairy. Apply at any bank branch with your Aadhaar, land records, and passport photo.",

    {
        "id": 7,
        "topic": "market_info",
        "question": "What is MSP and how do I sell at MSP?",
        "answer": "MSP (Minimum Support Price) is the guaranteed minimum price at which the government buys your produce. To sell at MSP: 1) Register on your state's procurement portal before the season. 2) Bring your produce to the designated APMC mandi or procurement centre. 3) Ensure quality standards are met (moisture content, foreign matter). FCI buys wheat and rice; NAFED buys pulses and oilseeds.",
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "topic": "organic_farming",
        "question": "How can I start organic farming?",
        "answer": "Start the transition: 1) Get soil tested. 2) Prepare compost (NADEP/vermi) — you need 5-8 tonnes/ha. 3) Replace chemical fertilizers gradually with FYM, vermicompost, Jeevamrut, and Panchagavya. 4) Use neem-based pesticides and bio-agents (Trichoderma, Pseudomonas). 5) Register under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) for Rs 50,000/ha assistance over 3 years. Full conversion takes 3 years for organic certification.",
    },
    {
        "id": 9,
        "topic": "irrigation",
        "question": "What are the benefits of drip irrigation?",
        "answer": "Drip irrigation saves 30-50% water compared to flood irrigation, increases yield by 20-30%, reduces fertilizer use (with fertigation), and decreases weed growth. It is especially beneficial for sugarcane, cotton, vegetables, and fruits. Under PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, small/marginal farmers get 55% subsidy on drip systems. Apply through your District Agriculture/Horticulture Office.",
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "topic": "general",
        "question": "How do I register on e-NAM?",
        "answer": "Register on enam.gov.in or through the e-NAM mobile app. You need: Aadhaar card, bank account details, and a mandi license (or register through your Farmer Producer Organization). e-NAM allows you to see real-time prices across mandis in India, get competitive bids for your produce, and receive payment directly to your bank account. Over 1,000 mandis across 18 states are connected.",

    {
        "id": 11,
        "topic": "pest_management",
        "question": "How to control fall armyworm in maize?",
        "answer": "Identify: Large caterpillar with inverted Y-mark on head, feeding inside the whorl. Control: Spray Spinetoram 11.7 SC @ 0.5 ml/L or Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L directly into the whorl. For biological control, release Trichogramma chilonis egg parasitoid cards at 1 lakh eggs/ha. Scout weekly from crop emergence. Use pheromone traps (5/ha) for adult monitoring.",
    },
    {
        "id": 12,
        "topic": "sowing",
        "question": "What is the best time to sow wheat in North India?",
        "answer": "The optimal sowing window for wheat in North India is November 1-25. Timely sowing yields 40-55 q/ha. Late sowing (after Nov 25) reduces yield by 30-40 kg/ha for each week of delay. For late sowing, use short-duration varieties (HD 3059, PBW 771) and increase seed rate by 25% (125-150 kg/ha). Very late sowing beyond December 25 is not recommended.",
